# ExploratoryDataAnalysis-EDA-
This repository is useful for data science projects.
It contains EDA files created by me for my projects.
EDA is used to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.
It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers we need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns,
spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.
